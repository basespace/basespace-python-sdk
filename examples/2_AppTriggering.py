This script demonstrates how to retrieve the AppSession object produced 
when a user initiates an app. Further it's demonstrated how to automatically
generate the scope strings to request access to the data object (a project or a sample)
that the app was triggered to analyze.
"""

"""
NOTE: this example requires that you provide an appSessionId that was generated
from launching your app. If you don't provide this, you will get the following
exception message: 'Forbidden: App credentials do not match AppSession application'.
"""

"""
NOTE: You will need to provide the credentials for your app (available in the developer portal).
You can do this with a master config file (preferred), or by filling in values below.
"""
# If you're not using a config file, fill in you app's credentials here:

# First we will initialize a BaseSpace API object using our app information and the appSessionId
if clientKey:

# Using the basespaceApi we can request the appSession object corresponding to the AppSession id supplied
myAppSession = myAPI.getAppSession()
print(myAppSession)

# An app session contains a referal to one or more appLaunchObjects which reference the data module
# the user launched the app on. This can be a list of projects, samples, or a mixture of objects  
print("\nType of data the app was triggered on can be seen in 'references'")

# by default we ask for write permission and authentication for a device
#accessMap       = myAPI.getAccess(myReference,accessType='write')
# We may limit our request to read access only if that's all that is needed
