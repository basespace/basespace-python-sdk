This example demonstrates the billing methods of BaseSpace.

Below a purchase is created, requiring the user to click 'Purchase' in a web
browser. The purchase is then refunded, and the purchase is again retrieved
via the API using the purchase id and tags, which are used by developers
to help clarify exactly what was purchased.

NOTE: You will need to fill client values for your app below
