Demonstrates the basic BaseSpace authentication process The work-flow is as follows: 
scope-request -> user grants access -> browsing data. The scenario is demonstrated both for device and web-based apps.

Further we demonstrate how a BaseSpaceAPI instance may be preserved across multiple http-request for the same app session using 
python's pickle module.

#################### Storing BaseSpaceApi using python's pickle module #################################
"""
It may sometimes be useful to preserve certain api objects across a series of http requests from the same user-session. 
Here we demonstrate how the Python pickle module may be used to achieve this end.

The example will be for an instance of BaseSpaceAPI, but the same technique may be used for BaseSpaceAuth.
In fact, a single instance of BaseSpaceAuth would be enough for a single App and could be shared by all http-requests, as the identity of 
this object is only given by the client_key and client_secret. 

(There is, of course, no problem in having multiple identical BaseSpaceAuth instances).
