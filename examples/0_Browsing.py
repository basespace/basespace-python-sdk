NOTE: You will need to provide the credentials for your app (available in the developer portal)
You can do this with a master config file (preferred), or by filling in values below.

To create a master config file, create a file named ~/.basespace.cfg with the following content,
filling in the clientKey, clientSecret, and accessToken (optionally appSessionId):
[DEFAULT]
name = my new app
clientKey =
clientSecret = 
accessToken = 
appSessionId =
apiServer = https://api.cloud-hoth.illumina.com/
